# Classification-of-undesirable-events-in-oil-well-operation
A realistic and public dataset with rare undesirable real events in oil wells published in the Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering

*ABSTRACT*
Detection of undesirable events in oil and gas wells can help prevent production losses, environmental accidents, and human casualties and reduce maintenance costs. 
The scarcity of measurements in such processes is a drawback due to the low reliability of instrumentation in such hostile environments. 
Another issue is the absence of adequately structured data related to events that should be detected. 
To contribute to providing a priori knowledge about undesirable events for diagnostic algorithms in offshore naturally flowing wells, this work presents an original and valuable dataset with instances of eight types of undesirable events characterized by eight process variables. 
Many hours of expert work were required to validate historical instances and to produce simulated and hand-drawn instances that can be useful to distinguish normal and abnormal actual events under different operating conditions. 
The choices made during this dataset's preparation are described and justified, and specific benchmarks that practitioners and researchers can use together with the published dataset are defined.
